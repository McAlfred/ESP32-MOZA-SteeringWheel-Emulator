# ESP32-MOZA-SteeringWheel-Emulator
This is a project of reverse engineering of MOZA Steering wheel. Based on MikeSzklarz / Arduino-Moza-Emulator.
## Before all
Special thanks to MikeSzklarz's [project](https://github.com/MikeSzklarz/Arduino-Moza-Emulator), without his work there's no way I could do this.

I have **not** complete this project yet, today is Oct 4 2025. This program now can only communicate with MOZA Wheelbase R9 emulated as an ES Wheel in sleep mode, when I turn on the working mode, it lost the connection.
